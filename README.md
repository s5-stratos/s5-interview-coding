Engage in TDD by making the tests pass.

There are 2 packages of tests:

* com.s5.interview.iter
* com.s5.interview.query.plan

Provide implementations for the stub classes that support the iter tests.
Use these implementations to provide implementations for the stub classes to make query.plan tests pass.

Feel free to ask questions and collaborate about design. 
It would be surprising if you were able to complete everything in a short amount of time, we are more curious about how you engage with a problem.
